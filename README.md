# My-Projects
LOG:

The project was created in a span of 5-7 days including optimization, design, and coding.
I apologize for the scarcity of comments in the project. Given my personal time constraint and that it was a personal project,
I felt that detailed comments were not neccesary. However, given that the code is now open sourced, I will begin giving details on the project for others who are interested in working with the project.
-UPDATE-
Added comments to Gamepanel, AI, and AITree class
